# Hello, I'm Laxmi Regmi

I'm learning full-stack web development with a focus on the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). I enjoy building small projects to practice what I learn and improve step by step. My main focus is writing clean code, understanding how things work, and becoming better with each project.

## What I'm Learning

- React.js, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS for building interfaces
- Node.js and Express.js for backend development
- MongoDB, Firebase, and Supabase for working with data
- Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration

I'm currently enrolled in a MERN stack training program, and I'm also working on personal projects to build practical skills.
