# Hello, I'm Laxmi Regmi

I'm learning full-stack web development with a focus on the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) with Next.js. I enjoy building small projects to practice what I learn and improve step by step. My main focus is writing clean code, understanding how things work, and becoming better with each project.

---

## What I'm Learning

- **JavaScript** and **TypeScript** for building logic and dynamic behavior  
- **React.js**, **Next.js**, and **Tailwind CSS** for creating user interfaces  
- **Node.js** and **Express.js** for backend development  
- **MongoDB**, **Firebase**, and **Supabase** for managing databases  
- **Git** and **GitHub** for version control and collaboration  
- Learning by doing through personal and project-based practice

I'm currently enrolled in a MERN stack training program, and I'm working on projects to apply what I learn in real scenarios.
